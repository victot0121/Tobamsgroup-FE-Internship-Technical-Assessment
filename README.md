# Tobamsgroup FE Internship Technical Assessment

## Project Overview
This project is a technical assessment for the Tobamsgroup Frontend Engineer Internship. The goal is to build a fully functional web page based on the provided Figma design using TypeScript, React, and preferably Next.js.

## Technology Stack
- TypeScript (required)
- React
- Next.js (preferable but not mandatory)

## Figma Design
The design for the web page can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/design/PZ9aNZQakGzH5CgjWY2nXg/Frontend-Interns-Assessment?node-id=1-296&t=x075fFJL9fwym8vw-0). Ensure that the implementation matches the design as closely as possible.

## Functionality
- The webpage is responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile (mobile responsiveness is not mandatory).
- All interactive elements specified in the Figma design are implemented.
- The webpage is accessible and follows best practices for web development.

## Code Quality
- The code is clean, maintainable, and well-documented.
- Industry best practices for code structure and organization are followed.
- Git is used for version control, with regular commits and clear messages.

## Performance
- The webpage is optimized for fast loading times.
- Heavy libraries are minimized, and images are optimized.

## Testing
- Unit tests are written for critical components.
- The application is free of major bugs and issues.
